## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Image of Values]MPG_p_and_r_value.png
- The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance are: vehicle length, vehicle weight, and ground clearance
- The p-value 5.35e-11 is significantly smaller that the assumed significance level of .05. Therefor, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means the slop of our linear model is not zero 
-The R-squared value is .7149 which means there is a strong correlation, so the linear model helps predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
